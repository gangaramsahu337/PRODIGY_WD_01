                <h2>Andromeda Galaxy (M31)</h2>
                <p>The Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and the largest galaxy in the
                    Local Group (The Local Group includes the Milky Way, Andromeda, and Triangulum galaxies, as well as several smaller galaxies). It is on a collision course with our galaxy and will merge with it in about 4.5 billion
                    years. Andromeda is the only galaxy that can be seen with naked eyes (it's the brightest and largest). Due to it's fuzzy appearance Ancient people often call it as star cloud or star mist. <br>[Distance: approx 2.5 million light-years away]</p>

                <h2>Orion Nebula (M42)</h2>
                <p>The Orion Nebula is one of the brightest nebulae in the night sky and is visible to the naked eye as faint, fuzzy patch in the "sword" of Orion (located in the constellation Orion) It is a stellar nursery where new stars are being born. Orion Nebula is the most studies and observed nebula in the sky, it has also been observed by many cultures throughout the history, for example, Ancient Maya believe it to be a cosmic fire of creation.

                <h2>Eagle Nebula</h2>
                <p>The Eagle Nebula is famous for the Pillars of Creation, a region of active star formation. Eagle Nebula is also known as "Star Queen Nebula" due to the dark silhouette near its center, which resembles a queen's crown. It is located in the constellation Serpens (in southern hemisphere sky). <br> [Distance: approx 7,000 light-years away]</p>

                <h2>Sombrero Galaxy</h2>
                <p>The Sombrero Galaxy is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation Virgo. It is known for its bright
                    nucleus and the large, dark dust lane that gives it the appearance of a sombrero. The central Bulge of the Sombrero Galaxy is unusually large and extended, containing billions of old stars that cause the diffuse glow. It can been seen from earth (in Virgo constellation) using a small telescope. <br> [Distance: approx 31 million light-years away]</p>
