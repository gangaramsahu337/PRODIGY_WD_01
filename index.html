            <h2>Constellations:</h2>
            <p>Discover the age-old tales of the constellations, such as the Greek hero Perseus rescuing Andromeda from
                sea monsters, the ongoing battle between the Sumerian king Gilgamesh (Orion) and the Heavenly Bull
                (Taurus), or Maui's fish hook that flung into the sky (Scorpius).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="content">
            <h2>Stars:</h2>
            <p>Learn about the stars, such as the eye of the bull (Aldebaran) protecting Pleiades (seven sisters) from
                Orion, the birth star of Lord Shiva
                (Betelgeuse), the heart of the Scorpius and the Rival of Mars (Antares), or a maiden holding an
                ear of wheat (Spica).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="content">
            <h2>Deep Sky Objects:</h2>
            <p>Dive deep into the sky and learn about the mysterious and majestic objects like galaxies, nebulae, great voids,
                GRBs, and black holes, which are located so far away that even the Big Bang seems like yesterday (even
                light can't make it on time).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="content">
            <h2>Sky Events:</h2>
            <p>Stay updated on upcoming celestial events, from meteor showers and eclipses to supernovas in our
                celestial neighborhood (e.g., Betelgeuse went supernova in 1054 AD and it might get visible to us anytime
                soon).</p>
